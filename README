OrionDB-rb

A ruby version of the OrionDB PHP transparency layer for Sproutcore.

Installation instructions will become available when it is more or less finished

Dependencies: rubygems, sequel, rack, cgi

Can be used together with apache using the mod_proxy module which forwards
the request to OrionDB-rb without the application noticing. (Reverse Proxy)

Add to the apache configuration 

Apache 1.3:
<IfModule mod_proxy.c>
   ProxyPass /proxy/ http://localhost:3000/
   ProxyPassReverse /proxy/ http://localhost:3000/
   <Location /proxy>
      Order Allow,Deny
      Allow from all
   </Location>
</IfModule>

Apache 2.x
still to come

will forward every request under http://host.com/proxy to OrionDB-rb (as long as it runs at 3000)

Will probably be available under MIT licence
